Hey there 👋. My name is Luke

### Full stack designer 🎨, developer 🛠 and military enthusiast 🔫

I love connecting brands and companies with their customers through good design, I can help you with logo, identity & digital design. 

Or maybe develop you whole website? *No trouble!* 👊
For the last 3 years I have been working mostly on  🚘 *automotive*  e-shops. Creating them a visual presentation, since sketch and wireframes up to site graphic, refine UX and CRO routes.

Also been developing and maintain own content management system [Aircms](http://tommyart.cz/aircms) for making a bussines presentation, landing pages, e-sport site and many many more. Just think about it. 🤯System is written pure in php with mysql database. Based on bootstrap 4.x framework with many custom things and upgrades. Able of simple editation with great user experiente etc. I dont use react in frontend, yet.

In a minimalistic and customer oriented way I solve problems on the daily for companies across the globe. There is nothing more fulfilling than seeing a company grow through my help 💯. But enough about me, how can I help you? 👀

**🎯 I will help your business grow.**
